## Business Scenario: GlobalTech Warranty & Subscription Management
 
### Overview
 
GlobalTech is a multinational technology company that manufactures and sells high-end electronics, including smartphones, laptops, and smart home devices. They operate in multiple industries and market segments, offering warranties for their products and subscription services for premium support and extended coverage.

The company needs a comprehensive Warranty & Subscription Management System that allows them to:

- Manage industries and product categories (Industry, Sub-Industry, Product Segment, etc.).

- Track company details (Company, Billing Address, Brand, Website).

- Handle warranties and claims (Warranty Claim, Warranty Coverage, Exclusions).

- Process subscriptions and invoices (Subscription, Subscription Invoice, Payment Methods).

- Monitor return merchandise authorization (RMA) for defective or returned products.

#### The system should support:

- Retail and B2B sales with multiple purchasing platforms.

- Tax compliance with stored tax identification numbers.

- Integration with Stripe for subscription payments.

### Key Features Mapped to Database Tables 

#### 1. Industry and Product Management

   GlobalTech operates in multiple industries and sub-industries and categorizes its products accordingly.
   
- industry and sub_industry: Defines the industry type (e.g., Electronics, Healthcare).

- product_segment and product_subsegment: Classifies products into segments (e.g., Smartphones, Smart Home Devices).

#### 2. Company and Brand Management
- company_name: Stores the official names of GlobalTech’s subsidiaries.

- company: Links company names to industries, brands, and billing addresses.

- brand: Stores GlobalTech’s different brands (e.g., GlobalTech Mobile, GlobalTech Home).

- website_url: Stores company website details.

#### 3. Warranty Management 
   Customers who purchase GlobalTech products receive warranties based on specific rules.

- warranty_claim: Stores customer claims for defective products.

- warranty_rules: Defines warranty coverage for different products.

- warranty_exclusion: Lists exclusions (e.g., water damage, accidental damage).

#### 4. Subscription Services
   GlobalTech offers premium support subscriptions that provide:

    Extended warranties.
    
    Faster claim processing.
    
    Additional services (e.g., on-site repairs).

- subscription: Stores subscription details like duration, amount, and trial period.

- subscription_invoice_list: Manages invoices issued to customers.

- payment_method & stripe_billing_details: Handles Stripe payment processing.

#### 5. Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA)
If a customer returns a defective product, it goes through an RMA workflow:

    The customer submits a return request.
    
    GlobalTech reviews the claim.
    
    The item is either replaced or repaired.

- rma_item: Tracks returned items.

- rma_status: Manages the status of return requests.
  

### Example Scenario: Customer Experience with Warranty & Subscription
 
    A customer purchases a GlobalTech Smart Home Hub.
    
    The purchase is linked to the company, product_segment, and warranty_rules.
    
    They subscribe to a premium warranty plan via Stripe.
    
    Their subscription is recorded in the subscription table.
    
    Payment is processed using payment_method.
    
    After 6 months, the device malfunctions, and they file a warranty claim.
    
    The claim is stored in warranty_claim and linked to their product.
    
    If the issue falls under warranty_exclusion, the claim is rejected.
    
    The customer returns the product for a replacement.
    
    The return is processed in rma_item, and its status is updated in rma_status.

This system ensures that warranties, subscriptions, and claims are handled efficiently while integrating Stripe payments and RMA processing.
